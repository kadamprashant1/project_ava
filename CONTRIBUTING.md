# Contributing to Project Ava

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Project Ava! It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please make sure the bug has not already been reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](<repository-url>/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](<repository-url>/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

## Code Contributions

We love code contributions! If you're ready to contribute code, here's how to set up your fork and submit a pull request.

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Make your changes**.
3.  **Write tests** for your changes. We value testing and a pull request with tests is more likely to be accepted.
4.  **Ensure the test suite passes**.
5.  **Format your code** according to the project's style guidelines. (e.g., using a linter like Black or Ruff).
6.  **Issue that pull request!**

### Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

-   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
-   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
-   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
-   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Python Styleguide

-   We follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.
-   We use a linter to enforce style. Before submitting a pull request, please run the linter and fix any issues.

Thank you for your contribution!
