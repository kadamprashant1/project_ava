# Frontend

This directory contains the Electron frontend for the agentic browser. It is a React application that provides the user interface for interacting with the browser and the AI agent.

## UI Components

The UI consists of the following components:

*   **Address Bar:** Allows the user to enter a URL to navigate to.
*   **Webview:** Displays the web page.
*   **Chat Panel:** Allows the user to interact with the AI agent. The user can enter a prompt, and the agent will respond with a plan and execute it.

## Usage

To run the frontend, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the Electron application.
